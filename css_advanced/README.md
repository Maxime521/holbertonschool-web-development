# CSS Advanced – SmileSchool Landing Page Clone

This project is a full reconstruction of the **SmileSchool** landing page using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal was to accurately reproduce a detailed Figma design, matching layout, spacing, colors, and typography.

## What I Built
- Recreated the entire layout from the Figma mockup: hero section, testimonials, video gallery, membership area, FAQ, and footer.
- Matched all typography, spacing, gradients, and icon positions using plain CSS.
- Used semantic HTML with reusable utility classes to keep the structure clean and maintainable.
- Implemented full-width sections (such as the hero and quotes) while keeping other content centered to match the original design.

## How to View the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Go to the `css_advanced/` directory.  
3. Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

No build process is required — the entire project is static.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – semantic structure of the full page.  
- `styles.css` – all styling rules (layout, typography, spacing, responsive adjustments).  
- `img/` – assets exported from the Figma design (icons, avatars, logos).
