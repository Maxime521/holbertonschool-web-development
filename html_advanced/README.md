# Project: HTML Integration from Figma Design

This project converts a Figma design into **pure semantic HTML**, with no CSS included.  
The goal is to produce a clean, accessible structure ready for future styling.

## 🎨 Figma Design

- Figma link: https://www.figma.com/design/ZeLH1U1DlaKi7QrNz66Mp4/Homepage--Copy  
- `.fig` file included (usable with Figma Desktop)
- Fonts used in the design: **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT**

> Duplicate the design to your Drafts in Figma to get full access to spacing, sizes, and exportable assets.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an `index.html` using **semantic and accessible HTML only**
- Respect the visual structure from the Figma file
- Keep the markup modular and easy to style later
- Do **not** write any CSS or inline styles
- Provide a solid foundation for the upcoming styling phase

## 🏗️ Expected HTML Structure

The page should include the following semantic sections:

- `<header>` — logo + navigation
- `<nav>` — primary navigation
- `<main>` — main content  
  - Hero section  
  - Features section  
  - Testimonials section  
  - Newsletter aside
- `<footer>` — links, legal info, contact
- A *skip link* for accessibility at the top of the page

No CSS is included at this stage.
